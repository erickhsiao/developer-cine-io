## Getting Started

Start off by creating an account at [cine.io](https://www.cine.io) or through
the heroku addon marketplace. We will automatically create you a project with
a default name of "Development". You can change your project names at any
time. You can create as many projects as you like. Each project will provide
you with a unique "Public key" and a "Secret key". A common usage is to create
a different project for your Development and Production environment (perhaps
also staging, canary environments, etc.).

Now you have your account `masterKey` as well as your project `publicKey` and
`secretKey`. Let's review the typical usage pattern.
